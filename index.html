<p>This is pretty damn frustrating. I see all these signs and weird languages that I have no idea about, and I'm just trying to work through it. It's like you go to China the first time and you have absolutely no idea of what people are talking about, but you just "think" you get it based on their body gestures. Same for coding, I have absoultely no idea what these codes are, what they even do, and most importantly why the hell should I care? This is a huge dilemma right now and it's pretty discouraging. But you know what? Let's just see how it goes. Maybe I'll get it, maybe I'll wont. You gotta first dive to see what's up with the ocean. </p>
